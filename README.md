# recipe-chatbot
 
## Usage
* Execute the "Start Server.bat" file

  ## Bot Usage
  The bot will first greet you and then start asking questions to get to know you in order to personalize the actions it can perform for you.
  Since its intent recognition is still very limited on the number of intents in the intent json files, you can check the intents in intents.json, ingredient_substition.json, recipes.json and nutritional_information.json if some intent does not work.
